# Hugo Template

Template project for sites built with Hugo, Decap, and Netlify

* Client:
* Netlify URL: https://hugo-template.netlify.app/
* Production URL:

## Installing

You need Hugo installed on your machine: <https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/>

This repository is set up to be developed with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. Please install reccommended extensions listed in [extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json)

If this is your first time running the project, run

`npx husky init`

When you have that run one of these commands for local dev server:

`hugo server` or `npm run dev`

and open your local site on http://localhost:1313/

## Development

We use [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming convention for CSS class names.

We follow the standard Javascript style.

### Linters

There are 3 linters set up:
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS/SCSS
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript
- [htmlhint](https://htmlhint.com/) for HTML

#### Linter Configuration Files

- `stylelint.config.js` - Stylelint configuration using ES modules
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration using ES modules  
- `.htmlhintrc` - HTMLHint configuration

#### Running Linters

```bash
# Run all linters
npm run lint

# Run individual linters
npx stylelint "**/*.scss"
npx eslint .
npx htmlhint 'layouts/**/*.html'
```

#### Auto-fixing

Linters will automatically fix issues when possible:
- **VS Code**: Auto-fixes on save (if recommended extensions are installed)
- **Command line**: Use `--fix` flag with eslint and stylelint
- **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically runs lint-staged which fixes staged files

#### Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit git hook is configured using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged). It:
- Runs linters only on staged files for better performance
- Auto-fixes issues when possible
- Prevents commits if there are unfixable errors

The hook configuration is in `.husky/pre-commit` and runs `npx lint-staged`, which uses the `lint-staged` configuration in `package.json`.

## Deployment

To deploy to production, push to `main` branch

### Development URL

There is no development URL out of the box. To create this environment, follow these steps:

1. create branch `develop`
2. Go to Netlify dashboard -> your site -> Settings -> Build & deploy -> Deploy contexts -> Edit settings
3. Under Branch deploys select Let me add individual branches and add `develop`
4. push some code to `develop` branch and see it on <https://develop--hugo-template.netlify.app>

## Additional setup

These configurations are optional based on the demands of your project.
